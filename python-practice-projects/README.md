# Python Practice Projects

This section contains small Python projects developed to strengthen programming fundamentals, logical thinking, and object-oriented programming concepts.

These projects were built as hands-on practice alongside my data analytics and reporting work.

## Projects

### 🕹️ Pong Game
- Classic Pong game built using Python and the turtle module
- Demonstrates object-oriented programming, event handling, and game loop logic
- Focuses on clean class separation and collision detection

### 🐍 Snake Game
- Python-based Snake game implemented using the turtle module
- Demonstrates game state management, collision handling, and file handling for score persistence
- Structured using multiple classes for better readability and maintenance
